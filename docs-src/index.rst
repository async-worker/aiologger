The builtin python logger is IO blocking. This means that using the
builtin ``logging`` module will interfere with your asynchronouns
application performance. ``aiologger`` aims to be the standard
Asynchronous non blocking logging for python and asyncio.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Python 3.6+
- *Optional*: aiofiles_ is required for file handlers

A word about async, Python and files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tldr; ``aiologger`` is only fully async when logging to stdout/stderr. If you log into files on disk you are not being fully async and will be using Threads.

``aiologger`` was created when we realized that there were no async logging libs to use. At the time, Python's built-in logging infra-structure was fully sync (still is, 3.8 beta is out). That's why we created aiologger.

Despite everything (in Linux) being a file descriptor, a Network file descriptor and the stdout/stderr FDs are treated differently from files on disk FDs. This happens because there's no stable/usable async I/O interface published by the OS to be used by Python (or any other language). That's why **logging to files is NOT truly async**. ``aiologger`` implementation of file logging uses aiofiles_, which uses a Thread Pool to write the data. Keep this in mind when using ``aiologger`` for file logging.

Other than that, we hope ``aiologger`` helps you write fully async apps. :tada: :tada:
